# 37 Years after the Guerrilla Girls 🦍, the Fight for Gender Representation in the Art World Continues
#### By Misha Vaid and Sarah Gotfredsen
### 📊 The goal of our project was to analyze the gender distribution in artists at (a) Museums in NYC and (b) art auctions at galleries in NYC 📊 

### MUSEUM ANALYSIS 
#### We focussed on the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art. All three museums put their collection on the web as a csv, but only  MoMA records the gender of the artist. We tried getting the gender of the artists for the other two museums using the Artsy API.   

#### We were not able to make the API requests in the same notebook, so each museum has a separate notebook. 

#### For the Whitney Museum, you can see "Whitney-final.ipynb"
#### For the MET, you can see "MET-final.ipynb" 
#### For the MoMA analysis, follow this link: https://github.com/SarahGrevy/moma/blob/main/artworks.ipynb 

### AUCTION ANALYSIS 
#### We wanted to look at gender representation in the auction market in New York specifically and how it compares today versus in 1985 when the Gorilla Girls were first established. We scraped the website of one of New York’s biggest art dealers, namely Christie’s, to examine 1) the price difference between gender and 2) the gender distribution in the sold artworks.
